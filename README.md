# Digital Gardener - Your GPT Agent in Obsidian

**Version: 0.1.0**

Thank you for checking out the Digital Gardener üßëüèº‚Äçüåæ For Obsidian.

The Digital Gardener is an _in progress_ tool that connects Obsidian to OpenAI-compatible APIs that drive a set of tools that
both simplfy the life of a user, and enable new forms of knowledge curation to be found and enabled.

You can ask it to find new knowledge, or search existing knowledge to find new connections and properties.

The agent is built upon some fixed queries, along with the future ability to add more customisation through
your own agents and prompts. One of the key values of the digital gardener is to provide flexability when
it comes to configuring how you interact with your agent.
